# tic-tac-toe

A responsive two-player Tic Tac Toe game built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project follows a modular structure using factory functions to keep game logic and UI handling separate.

The game supports local two-player gameplay with player name input, automatic turn handling, win and draw detection, reset and new game functionality, and smooth UI animations. The layout is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

The project is built with HTML for structure, CSS for layout, responsiveness, and animations, and modern JavaScript for game logic. No frameworks or external libraries are used.

To run the project locally, clone the repository and open index.html in a browser. No build steps or dependencies are required.

Project files include index.html, style.css, and script.js.
